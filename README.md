# Exercise 02 - Semantic HTML

Welcome to exercise 02 - all about semantic tags and a bit more structured content.

## Steps

1. Create a folder on your local machine to work in and open it up in VSCode
2. Create an `index.html` file in your local working folder
3. Copy the contents of the `index.html` file in this repository into your newly created `index.html` file
4. Using your knowledge of semantic HTML, start wrapping the block of text in the `index.html` file in HTML tags
5. Add `<header`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<img>`, `<h1> - <h3>`, `<nav>` and `<p>` tags to the document
6. The image of the bike is in the `\images` folder which you will also need to copy to your machine (I put a `height=200` attribute on the image so that it wouldn't be so big)
7. Use the screen capture / image below to help you structure the document. Your page should look like it at the end of the exercise
8. If you get stuck, have a look inside the `\solutions` folder for one way of putting this together
